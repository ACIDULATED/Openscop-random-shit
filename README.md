# Godotscop 2.0
This project, which has the name inspired and taken from the "Godotscop" project by "Lab Rat Software Works" (https://github.com/labratsoftworks/Godotscop), has the goal of being an open-source Petscop recreation engine that people can use for their own TGIFs, their own petscop fan projects, and whatever else.

The project runs on a modified version of MMOscop's source code with most sheet-related features removed, and no networking related code.
