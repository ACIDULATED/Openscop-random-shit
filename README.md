# Openscop
Openscop is an open-source Petscop recreation, it runs on Godot 4.1.1, it serves as a resource people can use it to make their own Petscop videos, fangames, and whatever else.
It is the result of the work of a bunch of awesome folks, and has been being worked on since February.

The project is open to contributions ranging from assets to code. To submit a contribution to this repo please issue a pull request or get in contact with me via discord: (@cheddar1460).
