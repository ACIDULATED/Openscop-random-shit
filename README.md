# Openscop
This project has the goal of being an open-source Petscop recreation engine that people can use for their own TGIFs, their own petscop fan projects, and whatever else.

The project runs on a modified version of MMOscop's source code with most sheet-related features removed, and no networking related code.

### The project's credits are now hidden within the game as an easter egg!! They can still be read by being accessed directly from the files though.
